Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional data from 3,900 purchases across multiple product categories. The goal is to uncover insights into spending patterns, customer segments, product performance, and subscription behavior to support data-driven business decisions.

Business Problem

A retail company wants to better understand how different factors such as customer demographics, discounts, shipping methods, and subscriptions influence purchasing behavior and long-term loyalty. The key question is how this data can be used to improve marketing strategies, customer engagement, and overall revenue.

Customer demographics including age, gender, location, and subscription status
Purchase details such as item, category, amount, season, size, and color

37 missing values in the review rating column, which were handled during data cleaning

Tools Used

Python for data cleaning and exploration
PostgreSQL for structured SQL analysis
